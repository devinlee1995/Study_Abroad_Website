				The months of January and February were particularly exciting ones due to the crazy amount of traveling that I did. A group of my friends from Queens College decided to visit Japan and asked if I could join them. I was happy to join them on their trip and serve as a tour guide. There were also places that I had never been to, and it was great to have them as travel companions. This was during my winter break, which lasted from Christmas to a few weeks into January. The first thing we did was stay in Osaka for a bit and move to see Kyoto for New Year’s. We all rented kimonos to celebrate the New Year, and it was a lot of fun to walk around with them. We went to a famous temple called Kiyomizudera and prayed for 2017. After exploring Kyoto for a bit, we quickly moved to see Osaka’s Tempozan ferris wheel. From there, we went to Koya San (Koya Mountain) to visit a Buddhist temple and ended up staying at a traditional Japanese inn there. It was the first time I got to stay at a traditional inn, and it was definitely a unique experience to sleep in futons (Japanese blankets) and stay in a tatami (bamboo) room. We were also given a traditional Japanese meal that was fully made of vegetables. It was delicious and an amazingly cultural experience. For the last part of our trip, we made a stop in Tokyo to see the Ghibli museum and the Tokyo Metropolitan Building. We saw amazing animation exhibits at the museum and Tokyo’s night sky at the Metropolitan Building. I then headed back to Kobe to start school again.

				I attended classes like usual, and to my surprise, another friend from America was coming to visit Japan. He was a student that studied abroad in Japan two years prior, and during that time, he stayed with a host family. He was visiting his host family and asked if I would like to visit them with him. I was more than happy to go and interact with an actual Japanese family. The family was extremely nice, and the host mom made us amazing food. I was lucky enough to talk to them about their experiences as a host family and how they usually live their lives. They let me stay the night, and I will never forget how welcoming the family was. It was truly as if they were my family for that weekend.

				At this point in my study abroad, I was actually supposed to leave in January to go back to Queens College. My study abroad trip was originally only for the fall semester, but due to how I loved spending time in Japan, I decided to extend for another semester. I had to visit a few offices at Kobe University to extend my stay and contacted my study abroad office in America to get permission to do so. I ended up getting accepted by Kobe University for the extension, and thus, I was able to stay another semester!

				Of course, I cannot leave out finals at Kobe University for the semester. They were not too bad, but I did have a difficult time remembering a lot of Kanji characters for the Japanese Language exams. I studied sufficiently, and by the time these exams were over, I immediately hopped on a plane to Hokkaido. It was the start of a very long break, from February to April. Every year, Hokkaido (located all the way in the north) holds snow festivals in the first week of February, and I knew that I had to go. I went with a friend to a few festivals and had an amazing time. We went to the Sapporo Snow Festival, the Asahigawa Snow Festival, the Otaru Snow Festival, and the Lake Shikotsu Ice Festival. We traveled all around Hokkaido by bus, and although it was a bit difficult to navigate, we ended up being able to go to all these places. For the last few days in Hokkaido, I spent time exploring another region called Jigokudani, which was known as Hell Valley. They had sulfur deposits with smoke coming out from the ground, and I had the pleasure of going to the hell onsen (hot spring). After relaxing, I came back to Kobe. It was only the beginning of my long break.
