				I had the entire month of March off, and I honestly spend the first week resting from all the traveling I did in February. I, however, was out and about again by the second week to meet my sister in Tokyo. She really wanted to visit and see Japan, so I served as a tour guide for her time in Japan. We stayed in a neighborhood called Takadanobaba, which is where Astro Boy is from! It was a cool area with a bunch of bars and ramen shops. It was thus the most lively at night. While my sister was in Tokyo, I took her to the usual places like Harajuku, Meiji Shrine, and Shibuya. Later on, we decided to see Mount Fuji, and it was breathtaking. It took 4 hours to get there, but it was worth the view. A fair warning to those that ever want to see the famous mountain: clouds cover the mountain quite frequently so it is best to go see it when there are no clouds in the sky at all. On the weather forecast, it told us that it was going to be 3% cloudy, but the mountain was still covered halfway by clouds. Luckily, we could still see the mountain.

				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				After touring Tokyo with my sister, we then flew to South Korea. My family is from South Korea, and it was almost a decade since we had last been there. We were curious to see how it changed since then. We decided to go to Busan, which was in the south. We had never went there, and it was interesting to hear the dialect spoken there. The city was surrounded by the sea and reminded me of Kobe. The food was absolutely delicious at the Gukje Market, and we definitely ate our hearts out. We also had the opportunity to sightsee, including a temple and cultural mural village. Busan had old architecture that was preserved during the Korean War, and it definitely had a different feel to other parts of South Korea that were more modern.

				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				From Busan, we took a train to the main capital, Seoul. We had been to Seoul in the past, and when we arrived, it looked like a completely different place. It was incredibly modern with a new train and bus system. The buildings also all looked new. We went to see sights such as Namsan tower and another mural village. Later on, my friend from Nagoya came to join me when my sister had left to go back to America. We went to the Korean War Memorial Museum and Nami Island for the following days. Nami Island was my favorite place in the entire trip, with beautiful bike routes and nature. 
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				We fully toured Seoul and made our way to Korea’s hawaii known as Jeju island. It was a tropical island with wonderful nature sights to see. We went to see the famous crater as well as sights along the coast. The water in Jeju was so blue that it almost looked fake to me. I unfortunately got rice poisoning near the end of the trip due to eating overheated rice cakes, but it did not stop me with my exploration! Crazily, I ended up walking up a hiking trail after terrible food poisoning. I always tell myself that if there is a will, there's a way. I luckily recovered by the end and eventually came back to Kobe.

				In the beginning of April, it was the start of another famous season in Japan. It was the start of cherry blossom season, which is arguably even more popular than the fall leaves season. From the previous blog post, I mentioned my friend’s Japanese host family, and they invited me in April to see cherry blossoms with them. Japanese citizens all go with their families and friends to do cherry blossom viewing and usually have picnics in parks. I was invited to have a picnic lunch with them, but due to how the season was a bit later than predicted, we did not see too many cherry blossoms. I still enjoyed being able to spend that time with a Japanese family, and later on when the cherry blossoms did bloom, I went to a BBQ hosted by my tutors from Kobe University. I also went to Shukugawa River to see cherry blossoms with friends, and then went to see Himeji Castle to see even more cherry blossoms. I made sure to see the cherry blossoms everywhere as I did with the fall leaves.

				Lastly, for my birthday, I decided to go on another trip to celebrate. My friend from Nagoya told me about a festival in an area called Takayama and said it was a super famous festival that we should go to. I thus traveled there with him and another friend. The festival was a traditional one, with extremely old parade floats. They were beautiful with intricate wooden and gold details. We also got to visit a famous shrine that inspired the shrine in a famous Japanese animation movie called Your Name. After having fun at the festival, we then went to a squirrel village the next day. Takayama was a beautiful, rural area with much greenery, and I enjoyed being able to explore yet another new area in Japan.
