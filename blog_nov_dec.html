				As mentioned in the last blog post, I was lucky enough to have presentations about Kobe University before starting my classes. After looking through the club manual that they gave me, I found a circle (a smaller, more casual club) for cooking. I felt that I would finally be able to cook after joining, and it was exciting because I would be the only exchange student there. That meant I could challenge myself to only speak Japanese. It was difficult at first due to how I did not know the Japanese for cooking materials, but with the help of the members and Google translate, I was able to help. My group was extremely friendly and helped me every step of the way. We made Japanese mixed vegetable rice called Takikomi Gohan and sweet potato mochi balls. Later on, we made a meat stew that was also really good. I found it so unique that Kobe University had such a plethora of clubs/circles and how the students were dedicated to whatever group they were a part of. While going to the cooking circle, I also ended up joining the Kenpo club, which was a Japanese martial arts club. I also wanted to learn how to do Japanese martial arts, and the members there were also extremely kind. They taught me moves in easy to understand ways, and I enjoyed practicing Japanese by only speaking Japanese to them too.

				Then, in the middle of November, I went to visit my friend at Nanzan University in Nagoya and got to explore another prefecture. Nagoya is in the middle of Japan, located in the Aichi Prefecture. It was definitely different from both Tokyo and Kobe. Immediately, I recognized how the sewer plate design was different in Nagoya. There were different designs in Tokyo, Kobe, and Osaka as well, so after seeing this, I hoped to see even more designs throughout Japan. After arriving, I was immediately escorted to Inuyama Castle by my friend and his friends. It was my first time in a Japanese castle, and I loved the architectural design. It was well preserved and made mostly of wood. One friend in the group was a Japanese student, and he ended up inviting us to his house for a meal. I was extremely excited due to how it was the first time I would be at a Japanese person’s house, and it was such a great experience speaking to his grandparents in Japanese. We all relaxed under a kotatsu (a Japanese heated table with a blanket), and later on, we played shogi (Japanese chess) to pass time. I really felt as though I had direct contact with a Japanese household, and it was a memory I would never forget.

				Later in November, there were also many more exciting events. First, there was the Kobe University school festival called Rokko-sai. It was a festival filled with food stands run by clubs/circles at Kobe University and performances by different groups. There were singers on stage and many people advertising the food they were selling. To help out my department, I also helped making Taiyaki, a fish-shaped Japanese dessert, at the festival. It was a lot of fun to interact with multiple students, both Japanese and International. Again, I could see a difference between my school and Kobe University with how the Japanese students put so much effort into the festival. They definitely took their activities seriously and organized an amazing festival for everyone.

				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				Secondly, by the end of November, it was the start of the Momiji (fall leaves) season in Japan. It is one of the most popular times to come to Japan, and I could definitely see why. The leaves turned a beautiful red all over Japan. I joined my department’s event to see the fall leaves and ended up going to a place in Kyoto called Arashiyama. Not only is this area famous for fall leaves, but it is also famous for its bamboo forest. I enjoyed speaking Japanese and talking to other international students on this trip, and we all had a lot of fun taking beautiful photos. I was so amazed by the leaves that I went on another trip with a fellow international student to Kyoto. We went all the way north to a temple called Sanzenin, and I would have to say that it was the most beautiful place in Japan that I had been to. It was an extremely quiet temple with beautiful nature surrounding it. There were many trees and vast areas with beautiful paths.
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				Transitioning to December, the leaves died out and a pretty warm winter began. My department decided to have an international cooking party to showcase our countries’ dishes, and I decided to join as a guest. I joined in the activites and got to eat dishes from countries like Thailand, Vietnam, London, and more. I really thought that it was super nice that we had these sorts of events because we could mingle with both Japanese students and international students. It was a great mix of speaking both Japanese and English. 
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				Later in December, there was an incredibly large event in Kobe to commemorate the anniversary of the Great Hanshin Earthquake that happened in 1995. It was a light festival called the Kobe Luminarie, and a lot of us went to commemorate the earthquake. After participating in the walk, I really felt as though I was a part of the Kobe community. Many people were there to reflect upon the earthquake, and it was a very powerful event.
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				Finally, near the end of December, Christmas had come. To celebrate Christmas, I decided to go to another amusement park and this time, it was Universal Studios Japan in Osaka. They had the largest fake Christmas tree in the world there, and I knew I had to go to see it. I also wanted to go to Harry Potter World, so it was hitting two birds with one stone. I had a lot of fun riding the roller coasters. On Christmas Day itself, I held a small party with friends at the dorm and did the modern Japanese traditions of eating a strawberry shortcake cake and fried chicken.
