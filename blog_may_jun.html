				The month of May was a calmer one in terms of traveling. I ended up staying in the Kansai region for the entirety of it, and I really enjoyed doing more activities during this month. It began with a Children’s Day celebration with my friend’s host family and their new host child for this semester. Children’s Day is a day to celebrate the happiness of children in Japan, and I was lucky enough to celebrate with the children of the host family. We ate a traditional Japanese sweet called Chimaki to celebrate the holiday. Later on, we also spent time at a nearby park to walk and take in nice sights.
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				Later on in the month, I ended up going to two different concerts in Osaka. The first one was a Korean pop concert by a band called B1A4. I never got to see a Korean band live, and it was a lot of fun to see a band in person. I accidentally hit a security guard while dancing at the concert, but other than that, everything went well. I then attended a Japanese Pop concert the week after and it was for a band called NEWS. I loved this band since I was in middle school, and it was a dream come true to see them live in Japan. They performed near Osaka Castle, so while I was waiting for the concert to start, I got to sightsee around the concert dome. These concerts were firsts for me, and I enjoyed noticing the differences between American concert audiences and Japanese concert audiences. The Japanese audiences at these concerts were extremely respectful and quiet when artists were speaking, and they did hand motions that were uniform. It was difficult to keep up with them at first, but sooner or later, I got the hang of it with my friend.

				As May came to an end, it was the beginning of summer in Japan. Yes, just like the rumors, it was extremely humid. Due to how the weather was so nice, the tutors of my department decided to throw a BBQ celebration for the international students, We roasted marshmallows and did fireworks. It was really nice to see the tutors again after so long, and we were all talking about how our breaks were. 
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				My traveling then began once June came around. A friend of mine really wanted to go to South Korea again as a weekend trip, and I decided to go with him to help as a guide. We ended up hiking a mountain in Seoul and just hung out around the city. After this South Korea trip, I then went to a new area in Japan called Shirahama for a job opportunity. Another friend told me about an opportunity to work with Japanese middle schoolers and speak English with them. It was a paid opportunity that also included free transportation and accomodation. The opportunity almost seemed to good to be true, and we ended up going anyways. We were able to see a beautiful, white sand beach on the edge of Japan and stayed at a 5-star Japanese inn. We also got to speak to Japanese middle schoolers about our respective countries. I spoke English and Japanese with them, telling them about America. They then presented information about me and America to their classmates. I really liked interacting with them, and they were a lot of fun to teach.  
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				My traveling, however, did not end there. Soon after in June, I decided to travel north to an area called Yamagata to later on meet a group of friends. I stayed at a farm by myself (which I booked through Airbnb) and had an amazing time in this rural town. The owner of the farm gave me a tour of the entire family and told me the history of the area. She also drove me to a nearby hot spring to take a bath and gave me fresh farm rice/eggs for dinner. I really felt at peace here and told her that I would definitely recommend her farm to others. (So recently, my friend went to Japan and stayed at her place due to my recommendation. She ended up recognizing me once my friend told her about me.) I did not, however, have much time to spend there and ended up leaving to a city called Sendai to meet my friends. Once we met up, we travelled to a famous fox village to interact with wild foxes. It was amazing to see foxes close up, and we got to touch actual foxes! We then quickly made our way to a famous island in that region called Matsushima (which is one of Japan’s top 3 views). We had a funny incident where a seagull stole my friend’s hot dog there, and we then split ways.

				Lastly, as the month of June came to an end, I decided that I wanted to see another top 3 sight of Japan. To my luck, it was located in Kyoto. It was a place called Amanohashidate, which was a sand dune that stretched across a body of water. It was absolutely beautiful walking on the sand dune, but the famous sight was actually seeing it from the mountain. Once you are at the top of the mountain, you look at the strip upside down to see the image of a dragon going up the sky. We all tried this and saw the image. It was an amazing way to end the month of June.
