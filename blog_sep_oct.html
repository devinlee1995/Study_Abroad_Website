				So before starting this amazing year-long adventure, I’d like to talk about how I prepared for my study abroad in Japan. It was a process that began in 2014 (since my freshman year). I knew from a very young age that I wanted to see Japan at least once, and later on, I realized that I could study abroad there during college. Due to how I had this goal in mind for a very long time, I started early by going to my study abroad office at Queens College during the summer of my freshman year. I walked in there, stating confidently that I would like to study abroad in Japan for my senior year and would like to know all the steps necessary for that to happen. They were surprised due to how early I was, and they said that they would put me first on their list for that time period. Because I asked them so early on, I was also able to choose what school I would go to in Japan. I thought long and hard about my potential choices, and I decided that I wanted to go to Kobe University. It was in the Kansai region, with areas like Osaka, Kyoto, and Nara being closeby. It seemed perfect for my Japan adventure. 
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				After it was decided that I would go to Kobe University as an exchange student, I had to think about the logistics. I realized that it would cost a lot of money for me to fly to Japan and live there. Due to how it would be difficult for me to afford this study abroad, I began searching for scholarships. Luckily, with the help of my academic advisor, I came across the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship. I applied online by filling out information about myself and writing two essays. With a lot of help from my advisor, I was able to edit my essays and send in the application. Luckily enough, I was chosen to receive the scholarship, and this really helped me fund my study abroad trip. WIthout the funding, it would have been really difficult for me to afford the trip itself, and I would advise anyone trying to study abroad to apply. It really makes a difference.

				Getting a student visa was the next step, and it was a simply application. I then had to go to the consulate in order for them to give me the visa. Overall, this process was a long one due to how I started early, but it was definitely not difficult through Queens College. I had to make sure I had a lot of paperwork in order, and it really helped to also keep an eye out for scholarships so that I could even afford it. To anyone that wants to study abroad: you can. It is not impossible due to time or financial constraints. There are many options out there, and you definitely need to plan. Plan and start early!

				Luckily for me, I did not have to start at Kobe University until October. This meant I had the month of September off, and I decided to explore Japan beforehand with a fellow classmate that was also studying abroad in Kobe. We set our first destination to Tokyo, since it was far away from Kobe. It was a super fun vacation filled with traveling and sightseeing. It was also difficult due to how we were inexperienced with using Japanese, but we definitely learned a lot from doing so. We went to places like Asakusa, Harajuku, Shinjuku, and Shibuya. (A personal favorite of mine was the Pokemon Center in Ikebukuro). I think one of the best parts of traveling around in Tokyo was that the transportation was super simple to follow, and Google Maps worked wonderfully there. There was no way of getting lost as long as we had our phones. Our accomodation was also cheap since we booked it through Airbnb. (Note: I will be referencing Airbnb as a holy grail when booking places to stay in Japan).

				This week in Tokyo was absolutely amazing, and I was even more pumped to start school in Kobe. I wondered how different it would be from Tokyo since it was in a different region, and I looked forward to hearing a different dialect. I ended up taking the world-renown bullet train (aka the shinkansen) to Kobe, and it only took a few hours for us to get there. We unfortunately came a bit late, and our tutors from the university were waiting for us. Also, by tutors, I mean volunteer students from my department at Kobe University. We were each assigned a student that would help us throughout the study abroad, and they also helped us get settled in. I had one nice tutor help me with my luggage when getting to the dorm.

				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				So for this study abroad, I stayed at the Port Island International Residence. It was located on a small Island off of the main part of Kobe, and it was a really nice area. It was super quiet and residential. And just like its name, my dorm was very international. It was filled with exchange students from all over the world. I quickly realized this on my first day there since everyone was so different. It made me feel at home since New York is also diverse. For the first day, we ended up filling out a lot of paperwork that involved our Japanese bank accounts, dorm logistics, and our health insurance. It was a nice way to bond with other students at the dorm, and then we set off to buy things for our rooms. Luckily, there was an IKEA that was a 10 minute walk away, so I ended up buying sheets and a pillow there. I was finally settled in.
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				I, however, did not start school immediately. There was a typhoon that hit Kobe, and we ended up having a day off.  I took this time to explore Osaka with new friends, and it was definitely a blast! We got to walk around the city and eat amazing food. It was a lot louder than Tokyo, and I enjoyed hearing the Osaka dialect when walking around.
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				I finally began school in October, and my first day was a fairly simple one. We toured the school with our tutors and had presentations about what we would need to do at Kobe University. The first presentation was a general one about Japan, and the second was about signing up for classes. Unfortunately, this process was not so easy to understand, and a lot of the students struggled with Kobe’s quarter system. They split the usual fall semester into two parts, and we had to sign up for classes in regards to these quarters. They also told us that we’d have two weeks to hand these in and check out the classes. They, however, did not tell us that for these two weeks, they would count attendance and that two absences would lead to automatic failure. I was fortunate enough to have gone to many classes, but other students did not and failed classes automatically. (I thus warned future students about this so that they would not go through the same experience).
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				When it seemed like everything was settled in terms of paperwork and logistics, I finally began to go to school regularly for Japanese language and culture courses. I was warned online about the death walk to campus from the train station, and boy, I did not believe what past students had said until I walked the path myself. The school is located on top of a mountain, and you legitimately need to walk up the entire mountain to get to the school. I was sweating waterfalls when going up the mountain, and I saw other exchange students suffering as well. It was incredibly steep and was definitely a leg workout. But due to how it was on top of a mountain, there was a gorgeous view of Kobe once entering the campus. It was right outside the International Center, and it was breathtaking to see it every day. It almost made climbing the mountain worth it. Almost.
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				The campus itself was also beautiful, with much greenery and hills. I explored the campus a lot to check out clubs and the cafeterias. I loved the food at the cafeterias as well due to how cheap and delicious the food was. I loved all the vegetable and tofu side dishes that I could choose for my meals. They would never come out to be more than $5, and I found that to be absolutely crazy. 
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				Finally, near the end of October, I had enough time on the weekend to go to DisneySea and Disneyland in Tokyo. I unfortunately did not have the chance to go in September, so I decided to go with another friend studying at Nanzan University. We went for the Halloween celebrations, and it was a crazy amount of fun! Although the bus trip was terribly long (8 hours), it was definitely worth it. It was a great end to the first two months I spent in Japan, and I knew there would be more to come.
