				I think it was at this point that it started to hit me that I would have to say goodbye to many of my friends at Kobe University, and this is why I decided to not travel as much for the last two months. I ended up hanging out with my friends locally a lot in Kobe, and it was definitely a lot fun to get to know them even more. 
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				For this Spring semester, I was a part of a Matsuri or Japanese festival class, and as a group, I had an assignment to research about a particular festival. There were many happening in the summertime, and my group decided to go to Fuchin Taisai, or the Festival for the Wind God, for our assignment. It was held at Tatsuta Jinja in Nara. This shrine was located in a relatively rural area, and we were the only foreign people there. A lot of people stared at us as we observed the festivities, which included purification and drum performances. Due to how we stood out a lot, the community council invited us to their personal party for the festival. We were lucky enough to drink and eat with them, discussing the history of the festival. They explained to us that it was an ancient prayer ceremony for protection against storm damage, poor harvests and epidemics. This is why they had performers do dragon dances and such for the festival. At the end, there was an amazing bon-odori, which was everyone dancing to traditional Japanese music. We also saw beautiful firework displays. It was amazing how we could connect directly with the planners of the festival and find out more about the festival’s traditions. We also talked about our own cultures with the community, and they told us that they were so happy we came to their event. They told us that they hope even more people come to their festival and that we tell more people about the event. We definitely did with our presentation later on, and it was a truly unique experience.

				Not only did I go to this festival, but I also went to another festival held by Kobe University called the Tanabata Festival It is an ancient festival based on the story of two lovers, and I went with a few friends. We all dressed up in yukatas (Japanese summer kimonos). It was difficult to walk in them, and unfortunately for us, it was extremely hot outside. We still had fun eating and walking around in our outfits.

				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				Later on in July, I ended up going to South Korea for the 3rd time. I wanted to wrap up my study abroad with another trip to Korea due to how I loved it so much. I ended up going to Seoul, doing local things such as going to a day spa and visiting a board game cafe. I also went to Nami Island again, and it almost felt like a goodbye to South Korea.
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				I had even more farewells in my last month as well. I visited my friend’s host family to say goodbye to them, and they threw me a farewell party filled with food as well. I also went to Kobe’s fireworks festival and said goodbye to many friends then. After many farewells, I made my way to Tokyo to get my flight back to America. I went to Disney yet again right before leaving. I was lucky enough to see some friends in Tokyo and said goodbye to them as well. I was terribly sad when leaving, and I finally said goodbye to Japan.   
				</p>
				<p class = "description" style = "color:#5bb5c1; font-family: 'Garamond Light'; line-height: 30px; padding-top: 20px;">
				So I said to myself, farewell my study abroad adventure. We did good.
